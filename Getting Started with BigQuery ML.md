## Task 1
###### To create a dataset, click on the View actions icon next to your project ID and select Create dataset.
###### Next, name your Dataset ID bqml_lab and click Create dataset.
## Task 2
###### In BigQuery Editor run following command
```bash
#standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
LIMIT 100000;
```
## Task 3
```bash
#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
